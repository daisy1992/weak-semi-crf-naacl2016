9303 b"Like I made him throw up when we were smoking in our friend's car one time, it was awesome"
9304 b"He's really into skateboarding now despite the fact that he gets thrown off of it and winds up with bandages and shit all over his arms every five minutes"

9675 b"Hey, a guy I know is breathing down my neck to get him some bud, anyway you'd be able to get a half track to usf tonight?"
9676 b"(I should add that I don't really care and if you can't I can at least get this dude to fuck off but hey, your money if you want it)"
9677 b'Yep, by the pretty sculpture'
9678 b"We're on the opposite side from where we dropped you off"
9679 b'Dad says hurry the hell up'
9680 b'Holy living christ what is taking you so long'
9681 b'Video games, you?'
9683 b"Yeah there's quite a bit left, I'll swing by tomorrow when I get up"
9685 b'Aight what time you want me to come up?'
9686 b"Aight I'll grab something to eat too, text me when you're back at mu"
9687 b'Jay up yet?'
9688 b'Aight should I just plan to come up later tonight?'
9689 b"That's cool, I'll come by like <#> ish"
9690 b"Alex knows a guy who sells mids but he's down in south tampa and I don't think I could set it up before like 8"
9691 b"And also I've sorta blown him off a couple times recently so id rather not text him out of the blue looking for weed"
9692 b'Awesome, I remember the last time we got somebody high for the first time with diesel :V'
9693 b'Aight, I should be there by 8 at the latest, probably closer to 7. Are jay and tyler down or should we just do two trips?'
9694 b"1 I don't have her number and 2 its gonna be a massive pain in the ass and i'd rather not get involved if that's possible"
9695 b"I don't have anybody's number, I still haven't thought up a tactful way to ask alex"
9696 b"What I'm saying is if you haven't explicitly told nora I know someone I'm probably just not gonna bother"
9697 b"Ok I'm gonna head up to usf in like fifteen minutes"
9698 b'Haha nice, will do'
9699 b"I'm at mu"
9700 b'(Where are you)'
9701 b"Hurry up, I've been weed-deficient for like three days"
9702 b"Also where's dobby at"
9703 b'"Gimme a few" was <#> minutes ago'
9704 b"Jay's getting really impatient and belligerent"
9705 b"We're all getting worried over here, derek and taylor have already assumed the worst"
9706 b'Still here so nyea'
9707 b'Yeah probably* my b'
9708 b'Like <#> , same question'
9709 b"Haha figures, well I found the piece and priscilla's bowl"
9710 b'I accidentally brought em home in the box'
9711 b"Probably not, I'm almost out of gas and I get some cash tomorrow"
9712 b'Where do you need to go to get it?'
9713 b"I think it's all still in my car"
9714 b'<#> w jetton ave'
9715 b'Also are you bringing galileo or dobby'
9716 b"Uh, heads up we don't have THAT much left"
9717 b"Id have to check but there's only like 1 bowls worth left"
9718 b'I could ask carlos if we could get more if anybody else can chip in'
9719 b'Yo, any way we could pick something up tonight?'
9720 b'Awesome, that gonna be soon or later tonight?'
9721 b"Carlos says we can pick up from him later so yeah we're set"
9722 b'K see you in a bit'
9723 b'How much are we getting?'
9724 b'K, makes sense, btw carlos is being difficult so you guys are gonna smoke while I go pick up the second batch and get gas'
9725 b"A bloo bloo bloo I'll miss the first bowl"
9726 b'He will, you guys close?'
9727 b'K actually can you guys meet me at the sunoco on howard? It should be right on the way'
9728 b"The gas station is like a block away from my house, you'll drive right by it since armenia ends at swann and you have to take howard"
9729 b'I AM AT THE GAS STATION. GO THERE.'
9730 b'Sorry that took so long, omw now'
9731 b"Alright we're hooked up, where you guys at"
9732 b'K omw'
9733 b'Here, get the door'
9735 b'Yes when is the appt again?'
9736 b"K and you're sure I don't have to have consent forms to do it :V"
9737 b"You're right I have now that I think about it"
9739 b'R u 4 real'
9740 b'K be there in a few'
9741 b'K here'
9743 b'Yeah I can still give you a ride'
9744 b'What why'
9745 b"How would my ip address test that considering my computer isn't a minecraft server"
9748 b'Its 1 am'
9749 b"I ain't answerin no phone at what is actually a pretty reasonable hour but I'm sleepy"
9751 b"How did you find out in a way that didn't include all of these details"
9752 b'Jesus armand really is trying to tell everybody he can find'
9753 b'I am literally in bed and have been up for like <#> hours'
9754 b'This is one of the days you have a billion classes, right?'
9756 b"Yeah that's what I thought, lemme know if anything's goin on later"
9757 b"Probably earlier than that if the station's where I think it is"
9759 b'Yeah imma come over cause jay wants to do some drugs'
9761 b'That means get the door'
9762 b'Please tell me you have some of that special stock you were talking about'
9763 b"Yeah, I'll leave in a couple minutes & let you know when I get to mu"
9764 b"I'll be at mu in like <#> seconds"
9766 b"You busy or can I come by at some point and figure out what we're doing tomorrow"
9767 b"I'll talk to the others and probably just come early tomorrow then"
9769 b"Sorry I flaked last night, shit's seriously goin down with my roommate, what you up to tonight?"
9770 b"fyi I'm at usf now, swing by the room whenever"
9771 b'(And my man carlos is definitely coming by mu tonight, no excuses)'
9772 b"Carlos is taking his sweet time as usual so let me know when you and patty are done/want to smoke and I'll tell him to haul ass"
9773 b'In other news after hassling me to get him weed for a week andres has no money. HAUGHAIGHGTUJHYGUJ'
9774 b'"Not really"'
9775 b'Yeah, we can probably swing by once my roommate finishes up with his girl'
9776 b"Meanwhile in the shit suite: xavier decided to give us <#> seconds of warning that samantha was coming over and is playing jay's guitar to impress her or some shit. Also I don't think doug realizes I don't live here anymore"
9777 b'Jay is snickering and tells me that x is totally fucking up the chords as we speak'
9778 b"Sweet, we may or may not go to 4U to meet carlos so gauge patty's interest in that"
9779 b"I'll let"
9780 b"Oops, I'll let you know when my roommate's done"
9781 b"Also where's the piece"
9782 b'Negative on both'
9783 b'How long does applebees fucking take'
9784 b"Tell them the drug dealer's getting impatient"
9785 b'Aight do you still want to get money'
9786 b"I've got ten bucks, jay is being noncomittal"
9787 b"jay says he'll put in <#>"
9788 b"None of that's happening til you get here though"
9790 b"Jay says that you're a double-faggot"
9791 b'It was pretty eh'
9792 b'You do got a shitload of diamonds though'
9793 b"Same here, but I consider walls and bunkers and shit important just because I never play on peaceful but I guess your place is high enough that it don't matter"
9794 b"No idea, I guess we'll work that out an hour after we're supposed to leave since as usual nobody has any interest in figuring shit out before the last second"
9795 b'Well boy am I glad G wasted all night at applebees for nothing'
9796 b'Speaking of does he have any cash yet?'
9797 b'You at mu? You should try to figure out how much money everyone has for gas and alcohol, jay and I are trying to figure out our weed budget'
9798 b"You might want to pull out more just in case and just plan on not spending it if you can, I don't have much confidence in derek and taylor's money management"
9799 b'Yo you guys ever figure out how much we need for alcohol? Jay and I are trying to figure out how much we can safely spend on weed'
9800 b"<#> , that's all? Guess that's easy enough"
9802 b"Think I could stop by in like an hour or so? My roommate's looking to stock up for a trip"
9803 b"Awesome, I'll see you in a bit"
9804 b"Jason says it's cool if we pick some up from his place in like an hour"
9805 b'Sorry my roommates took forever, it ok if I come by now?'
9806 b'Cool, be there in 5'
9807 b"What's your room number again? Wanna make sure I'm knocking on the right door"
9808 b'Just arrived, see you in a couple days <3'
9809 b"Yep, at derek's house now, see you Sunday <3"
9810 b'Guess who spent all last night phasing in and out of the fourth dimension'
9811 b"(It wasn't me)"
9812 b"(You didn't hear it from me)"
9813 b'Yep, the great loxahatchee xmas tree burning of <#> starts in an hour'
9814 b"Where all y'all at"
9815 b'<#> great loxahatchee xmas tree burning update: you can totally see stars here'
9817 b'Are you sure you don\'t mean "get here, we made you hold all the weed"'
9818 b"K I'll be there by 9"
9819 b'Somebody should go to andros and steal ice'
9822 b"Ugh fuck it I'm resubbing to eve"
9823 b"Nothing really, just making sure everybody's up to speed"
9824 b'I can make it up there, squeezed <#> bucks out of my dad'
9825 b'Also andros ice etc etc'
9826 b"K I'm leaving soon, be there a little after 9"
9828 b"Nah can't help you there, I've never had an iphone"
9830 b'Probably not, still going over some stuff here'
9831 b'Omw home now though'
9832 b"We're aiming for 8"
9833 b'Talk to g and x about that'
9834 b"I'm already back home so no probably not"
9835 b'<#> w jetton ave if you forgot'
9836 b'Just dropped em off, omw back now'
9837 b"I'll probably be by tomorrow (or even later tonight if something's going on)"
9838 b'Well keep me posted'
9839 b'Jay told me already, will do'
9840 b"Then get some cash together and I'll text jason"
9841 b'Yo you around?'
9842 b"K, jason says he's gonna be around so I'll be up there around <#>"
9843 b'Haha, my legs and neck are killing me and my amigos are hoping to end the night with a burn, think I could swing by in like an hour?'
9844 b"Cool, I'll text you when I'm on the way"
9845 b"Also remember to get dobby's bowl from your car"
9846 b'Also track down any lighters you can find'
9847 b"Also remember the beads don't come off. Ever."
9848 b'You unbelievable faglord'
9849 b"If I was I wasn't paying attention"
9850 b'Dad wanted to talk about the apartment so I got a late start, omw now'
9852 b"Sorry, got a late start, we're on the way"
9853 b"Fwiw the reason I'm only around when it's time to smoke is that because of gas I can only afford to be around when someone tells me to be and that apparently only happens when somebody wants to light up"
9854 b"Sure, if I get an acknowledgement from you that it's astoundingly tactless and generally faggy to demand a blood oath fo"
9855 b"From someone not to smoke when every time I've smoked in the last two weeks is because of you calling or texting me that you wanted to smoke"
9856 b"I'll see if I can swing by in a bit, got some things to take care of here firsg"
9858 b"I'm not coming over, do whatever you want"
9859 b'Haha fuck you'
9860 b'Maybe you should find something else to do instead???'
9861 b"Well there's a pattern emerging of my friends telling me to drive up and come smoke with them and then telling me that I'm a weed fiend/make them smoke too much/impede their doing other things so you see how I'm hesitant"
9862 b'Tell you what, if you make a little spreadsheet and track whose idea it was to smoke to determine who "smokes too much" for the entire month of february, I\'ll come up'
9863 b'Looks like you found something to do other than smoke, great job!'
9864 b"You're not sure that I'm not trying to make xavier smoke because I don't want to smoke after being told I smoke too much?"
9865 b"Wait that's still not all that clear, were you not sure about me being sarcastic or that that's why x doesn't want to live with us"
9866 b'I\'m not smoking while people use "wylie smokes too much" to justify ruining my shit'
9867 b"I know I'm lacking on most of this particular dramastorm's details but for the most part I'm not worried about that"
9868 b"I remain unconvinced that this isn't an elaborate test of my willpower"
9869 b'Sounds like something that someone testing me would sayy'
9870 b"Doesn't g have class early tomorrow and thus shouldn't be trying to smoke at <#>"
9871 b'It just seems like weird timing that the night that all you and g want is for me to come smoke is the same day as when a shitstorm is attributed to me always coming over and making everyone smoke'
9872 b"Well keep in mind I've only got enough gas for one more round trip barring a sudden influx of cash"
9873 b"(Btw I'm not coming)"
9874 b"Why don't you go tell your friend you're not sure you want to live with him because he smokes too much then spend hours begging him to come smoke"
9875 b'About it'
9876 b"I think that tantrum's finished so yeah I'll be by at some point"
9877 b'Btw regarding that we should really try to see if anyone else can be our 4th guy before we commit to a random dude'
9878 b"Yeah that'd pretty much be the best case scenario"
9879 b'Yeah if we do have to get a random dude we need to change our info sheets to PARTY <#> /7 NEVER STUDY just to be safe'
9880 b"No we put party 7 days a week and study lightly, I think we need to draw in some custom checkboxes so they know we're hardcore"
9881 b'Yeah but which is worse for i'
9882 b'Derp. Which is worse, a dude who always wants to party or a dude who files a complaint about the three drug abusers he lives with'
9883 b'You should change your fb to jaykwon thuglyfe falconerf'
9884 b"Yeah hopefully, if tyler can't do it I could maybe ask around a bit"
9885 b'Haha, that was the first person I was gonna ask'
9886 b'Gumby\'s has a special where a <#> " cheese pizza is $2 so I know what we\'re doin tonight'
9889 b'Ugh fucking typos'
9891 b'Jus chillin, you?'
9892 b'Yeah why not, is the gang all ready'
9893 b"Then I'm on mah way"
9894 b"I'm here"
9895 b'Nothing I guess'
9899 b'Playin space poker, u?'
9900 b'Somebody set up a website where you can play hold em using eve online spacebucks'
9901 b"I don't know but I'm raping dudes at poker"
9902 b'on a Tuesday night r u 4 real'
9904 b'You best watch what you say cause I get drunk as a motherfucker'
9905 b'You flippin your shit yet?'
9906 b'Maybe later tonight'
9907 b"Sorry battery died, yeah I'm here"
9908 b'No my phone battery'
9909 b"And I don't plan on staying the night but I prolly won't be back til late"
9910 b"Sure, I'll see if I can come by in a bit"
9912 b'Lol yeah at this point I guess not'
9913 b"Oh fine, I'll be by tonight"
9914 b"I'm omw now, be there a little after <#>"
9917 b'Yo what you up to?'
9918 b'Haha better late than ever, any way I could swing by?'
9919 b'Awesome, be there in a minute'
9920 b'Wylie here'

9923 b"Takin a shower now but yeah I'll leave when I'm done"
9924 b'at bruce b downs & fletcher now'
9925 b'At mu now'
9926 b'Yep noted'
9929 b"Unless it's a situation where YOU GO GURL would be more appropriate"
9931 b"I don't know jack shit about anything or i'd say/ask something helpful but if you want you can pretend that I did and just text me whatever in response to the hypotheticalhuagauahahuagahyuhagga"
9936 b'Not a drop in the tank'
9937 b"Yeah I'll try to scrounge something up"
9938 b"Well there's still a bit left if you guys want to tonight"
9939 b'I meant just you guys'
9940 b'Do I? I thought I put it back in the box'
9941 b'Want to finally have lunch today?'
9942 b"I'll get there at 3, unless you guys want me to come some time sooner"
9943 b'Usf I guess, might as well take 1 car'
9944 b"In that case I guess I'll see you at campus lodge"
9945 b'If I get there before you after your ten billion calls and texts so help me god'
9946 b'Will do, maybe monday'
9947 b'Yo guess what I just dropped'
9948 b"(It's acid)"
9949 b"I'll let you know when it kicks in"
9950 b'Yeah like if it goes like it did with my friends imma flip my shit in like half an hour'
9951 b'I keep seeing weird shit and bein all "woah" then realising it\'s actually reasonable and I\'m all "oh"'
9952 b'Yeah, probably here for a while'
9953 b'Total disappointment, when I texted you was the craziest shit got :('
9954 b'K lets do it'

11072 b'Lol I know. Yesterday was so bad. Everything I did was wrong. I felt like Charlie Brown'

11100 b'Lol I know. And he suggested the contacts. So I asked him are u cheating on me?'
11101 b'Lol I did. No evidence'
11102 b"I checked online. In case he deleted anything off his phone. I know I'm terrible. But I had to check."
11103 b'We went to the eye doc today. I was gonna txt u earlier but they dilated my eyes and small words were blurry.'
11104 b'Lol I know. At least they got rid of the puff of air in your eye. I really hated that. Docs suck. I donno y women r so determined to marry them.'

11108 b'Send it on over!'
11110 b'Really? Cause I want the moon...'
11111 b"It's cheaper to do a plan with me. Unlimited everything is required if u want a good phone. By yourself on Verizon with your discount is $ <#> /month. Adding to mine would be an extra $ <#> . That is for the plan. Phones are cheaper at best buy. HTC evo shift is $ <#> there. At sprint.com its $ <#> . It's a good deal."
11112 b'When is your next break?'

11117 b"I know. Like when she was taking FOREVER to bring my pain meds. I found out why too. She thought I legally changed my name to Cortez. So they couldn't find it."
11118 b"No! I never wanted to. But everyone kept hounding me about it. Even my dad asked Mark if he was really gonna 'let' me keep my last name. So I just changed it on FB to shut everyone up :/"
11119 b'Lol well they left me alone after that'
11120 b"nobody I know uses a house phone. It's all cell phones."
11121 b'Cause I keep forgetting to buy lotto tickets'
11123 b'Joanna got scammed. I warned her about it a week ago but she blew me off. Tsk tsk tsk'
11124 b'They found a way to change the item they put in trade to look like an <#> costume. Your really getting a bikini bottom or something cheap. But on your end it will show up as the right costume. Ppl have been making threads about it on the forums for weeks now. Ninjas just close them and say they are false rumors.'
11125 b'But it happened to Joanna today. She traded <#> k for pb bunny that ended up being pants. I warned her tho. She said she was gonna buy an <#> to resell later for profit.

16213 b'I really quite dulan, so I not coming back for nx 2 days. His stressskin giving me problems since day 1 and I had never hear an apology ofany sort or their offer to help for the extra work I have been doingbecause of their mistakes.'
16214 b"Btw, pls show them these messages if u haven. Discuss what? Wed isimpossible, easier said than done, I machine each to fking length costhe stress skin thickness diff at diff point. Alu is freakingmakeshift, still want to any how make them in short amount of time,and these r critical parts. If want to do it, do it gd or don't do itat all. He is the one who say his stressskin better than steel bars."
16215 b"Ok here's my stand. I can't be bothered to put in extra effort forthe better of the car if they can't treat a fellow team memberproperly. Don't forget yuhui example."
16216 b"I dowan our batch to help, its not just abt the work. Like I said,the way they treat us is not worth our effort to make the car better.If he insist on it, my stand is simple, either their batch go dosomething abt it on their own, or nothing is going to be done abt it.Gautham, I'm sending this to u too as I dowan bernard to be themiddleman. If u find this unreasonable, pls find bernard and take alook at the previous msg I've send if u haven."
16218 b"Ok, gautham, andre talked to me and I do agree that I am at fault forflaring up. I handled this wrongly. I have many considerations in mindwhen I hear abt the 'solution'. I think we shld discuss what shld bedone asap. Tml ok for u?"

28218 b'Hi Ricky, can we meet you tomorrow at <TIME> at your IMM branch? Thanks.'
28219 b"BTW, have yet to hear from your electrician or air con people. Alsowe'd like to check with you about the attic space, whether it needsBCA approval and the estimated cost. Thanks :-)"
28220 b'Sure, no problem. :-) happy to help. We are slated to more outright before the rental period expires, but would definitelyappreciate if Desmond can give us some leeway for moving out at apro-rated rate, if we need to extend due to renovation delays. Itwould certainly make our move to the new place less stressful.Thanks!'
28221 b'Hi Ricky, any news from the air con guys? BTW, we are going to haveour own electrician staff come down after all. They will be coming tothe house on Sat, time TBA. Thanks!'

28225 b'Hi Jiayu, my email is <EMAIL> . thanks!'
28226 b'Hi Ricky, I did receive your guys electrical quote,but it did notitemize by area, so its impossible to decide what to take and what toforgo. I thought I forwarded it to you?'
28227 b'The aircon quote seems to use the old, original drawings. Is theestimate based on the new third floor? The quote specifies that the2nd floor should take less BTUs than the 3rs which is wrong. We arealso thinking of only doing the guest room on the 1st floor, no hall.Can you double check?'
28228 b'Finally, for the attic, can your guy design it as a trapdoor in theceiling? Then no other walls or doors on the attic level necessary.Thanks for your help!'
28229 b'Hi Sis, happy weekend ahead. Just wondering, do you know theconfirmed time when your guys are planning to go to the house? Needto confirm with the designer whether ok. Thanks!'
28230 b'Ok, will do. Am trying to confirm the timing for tomorrow and willtry to get the drawings to you for your consideration. In youradditional quote, why is the mirrors on the wardrobe chargeable? Ithought the wardrobe price was inclusive of any finishing. Is thatnot the case?'
28231 b"Hi jiayu, I've received the softcopy of the invoice. Thank you!"
28232 b'Thanks. See you then.'
28233 b"Will do. Thanks. If we want other sink or wc than provided thenwhat's the method we should follow?"
28234 b'Ok, I see. Will discuss next time.'
28235 b'Hi Ricky, for the aircon, can you get the quotation to specificallystate that Theme are doing all new copper piping with what thicknessand type of insulation? That is important to have on the quote. Ifall then ok, we may sign with Gavin. Will still be checking with theother company.'
28236 b"As for your feature wall design, we think your design is not quitethere and looks unfinished. I will repropose design and send to youfor your feedback. In particular, the partition and feature wall don'tlook connected or contiguous. Also, thought that you were going toconnect it to the cove light?"
28237 b"Finally, since the maid's bathroom is demolished, we need to enlargethe wet kitchen. Will send you the new layout shortly."
28238 b'Will do. Thanks'
28239 b"Hi Sis, I've sent you the new wet kitchen layout according to ourdiscussion yesterday night to your yahoo account. Thanks for you andyour company's help again!"
28241 b'Sure, can pass u keys tonight. Is that ok? Thanks! :-) :-)'
28243 b'Hi Sis, the padlock is <#> . Front door currently not locked.'
28244 b'Ok. Will do. Thanks :-)'
28245 b"Hi Ricky, we'll meet you tomorrow at IMM at around <#> : <#> as usual?"

28247 b"Hi Diane, thanks for your answer. If I go to the HSBC branch, do youknow how long it takes to have a cheque's funds clear?"
28248 b"Hi, you messaged me twice, but I'm not sure who you are. Can youcheck whether you sent to the correct person? Thanks."
28249 b'No probblem. Meet at <TIME> pm tomorrow as you requested at my office.'
28250 b'Hi Ricky, can you get your people to take down the air con blower inthe 2nd floor old MBR? The electrical folks need it removed ASAP?Thanks!'
28251 b'Hi Ricky, never mind about the last SMS, the electrical folks figureda way around it. Thanks, and sorry for the hassle.'
28252 b"Hi Sis, sorry but I don't know what a cct is. We don't have anyschematics or wiring diagrams of the house. The floorplan that youhave is the only blueprint that we know of. I will go back and doublecheck and let you know."
28253 b"Ok. That's perfect. No rush."
28254 b'Ok. How late? <TIME> ? We are already on site. Thanks!'

34810 b'Cmi but also cannot like that right... sigh suan le.'
34811 b'Well it was a sure no. But nvm.'
34812 b'Dont have to feel bad,was just saying. Enjoy your outing.'
34814 b'How are you feeling now?'
34815 b'Irp you mean. Picked truman.'
34816 b'Done yet? We gotta leave soon.'
34817 b'Cus my mom might be waiting for me for lunch.'
34818 b'But arent we going ikea? You ready?'
34819 b'Not done yet ah? Nvm I will wait then.'
34820 b'Okay hurry up.'
34821 b'You are gonna take a longer time than expected? I thought you could have been done by <#> ?'
34822 b'I dont know. I am supposed to inform her when I am done,but I havent done so yet.'
34823 b'Seriously? Then how about you?'
34824 b"My mum's gonna wait at jurong point for me now. Wanna meet up before I leave?"
34825 b"Cus it's closer for her. Found the person yet?"
34826 b'uhh I am outside your cluster..'
34827 b'Dont leave house too soon. I still have to pack up and go to the bus stop.'
34828 b"Sorry. I just dont get why this issue is worthy for us to argue about. It's possibly the last lunch this year,but cant we just take ytd's lunch as the last lunch?"
34829 b"I promised yours if it occured at <#> pm. That's why i agreed to meeting up with my mom for lunch since I will be able to make it if the ikea outing were to begin at <#> pm. I am sorry to disappoint you. We can have lunch next time too. Isnt that so?"
34830 b"Last impression? You are making it seem like.everything is gonna end and there's no more future. I remember telling you before that I hope for our relationship to be a casual one. I said I wont be too serious about it and will allow you to get past with almost anything you want. I dont see the point in becoming so angry over this when we have plenty of time in our lives left to spent."
34831 b'Making out doesnt mean I am serious or anything. And you threw the casual idea away,i didnt. I still hope we wont be too serious about this. Obviously we have quite different expectations from this relationship.'
34832 b'Meet you at where? I havent had lunch yet.'
34833 b'For lunch?'
34834 b'See what I can tell.my mom.'
34835 b'Okay. Meet you in a while.'

34853 b"Six Feet Under. It's a kinda family drama show. Yeah buffering rate is downloading rate. Downloads as much as it loads."
34854 b"No,i happened to find out that it's rated as one of the greatest tv series in history so I am giving it a try. It isnt comedy,more like drama. Just dl funshion and find the show you want and it will automatically loads and downloads."
34855 b'Funshion. not only eng shows. There are other shows too.'

40930 b"Oh ok. Uhh no i didn't touch code at all today :/ i'll look into it after dinner"
40931 b"Lol there isn't a direct bus I'm better off walking. And i tried with the old one, the seat itself isn't too bulky. I'll notify when i head over to the library"
40932 b"Just got on <#> to go ikea, i'll probably finish by ~ <#> h to <#> h"

40937 b'Yeah i was soldering in the morning the friday i go gayparty with nat'
40938 b'Uhh tmr morning i need to get 1 or 2 parts i ran out of from sim lim.'
40939 b'Just spotted someold dude in the current hci pe shirt. Mann you funky.'
40940 b'Whoop 3 rounds of pong at ZoneX :3'
40941 b"Ok i'll have dinner before going"
40942 b"Ok i'll start making my way now"
40943 b'Evening commute is crowded as crap. Just got on train'
40944 b"Tonight I'll be at Nat's house to work on robot, if the need arises can I stay overnight?"
40945 b'Yes i ate dinner and bathed already'
40946 b"Uhh i'll see how later goes. I don't exactly have logistics for staying over and if we're going down to school to test I don't have school clothes; but I think it'll be damn late then no buses asdf lol"
40947 b"Yeah i'll notify at about <#> h"
40948 b'Not staying over, but may stay until <#> h'

40950 b'You tried with the other shield right ._. So we not labbing tmr?'
40951 b"Bah I sort of knew it. I'll check connections and solder"
40952 b'Uhh so when are you going down/are you there already ._.'
40953 b"Oh ok i'll send you updated code after lunch"
40954 b"Actually i'm at home alr just come over"
40955 b"Uhh you don't want to bring the whole robot? Cuz easier to see effects"
40956 b"Truedat... Up to you; you're the one moving the stuff around"
40958 b"I think we'll be ok working anywhere so just start work in the morning at school and move the board around"
40959 b'Oh ok sure thing but can i pick the bots up earlier to work on just coding'
40960 b"I'll leave my house arnd 8+ reach your place about 9 then go up grab stuff go school; it's ok rite"
40961 b'Probably just the robot and a cable + parts to test'
40962 b'Yep yep definitely'
40963 b'Just got on bus, i say ~ <#>'
40964 b'Lol idk if i can carry 2 robots :/ see how later'
40966 b'Lol i ate alr but if you want to get then just the sausage mcmuffin meal'
40967 b'I just got off the bus. Walking back'
40968 b":/ seems fine over here i'll check once whole system up"
40969 b'Just 1 byte per loop gives both strength and direction...'
40970 b'Ok noted. Btw now ultrasonics range every loop but only read when no ir, slight improvement in speed'
40971 b"Megas are dying wtf pwms all wonky And i think i know what you meant by back ir lagging. It's the analog write when setting the motor speed :/"
40972 b'It starts on the <#> th but 1 week of blocks'
40973 b"It's some werid shit going on with serial when i run analog write, even without setmove :/ Hard to say exactly what is wrong with the uno but yeah just get those few i don't think need anything unless you want another driver for dribbler."
40974 b"I isolated the problem to both roboexps. Apparently the values are returned at high speeds but the sensors lag before updating the value (so it's not the communication). And somehow only when the pwms are running. Looking for a workaround will get back to you."
40975 b"Ok uber gl workaround: if final pwm value is > <#> , send a digtal high instead. So far the actual movement doesn't look too affected"
40976 b'Me (shungit)'
40977 b'Yeah vid soon'
40978 b'Uhh flick the dip switches up and move the serialing wire from Serial2 to Serial3 oops i forgot'
40979 b'Yes exactly.'
40980 b'Welp, traffic'
40981 b'Uhh ok lol'
40982 b"Well just don't make too much noise and stuff :/"
40983 b'Lol expected'
40984 b"Nah it's ok. Take your time to laugh at the people queueing for koi."
40985 b'Yep 9th floor'
40986 b'Ahahaha you should totally put a count on the box'
40987 b'Ohcrap sorry just saw this uhh just use the old one first'
40988 b"Uhh i don't have it with me now, I'll get back to you when I do"
40989 b'The example looks fine to me. Completing the square is correct ( 5 + 4x - x^2 = 9 - 4 + 4x - x^ ), nothing else looks suspicious'
40990 b'But does pulling them up manually work'
40991 b"Uhh i was cleaning up my desk and my nose decided to run; you guys move on ahead and settle down first, I'll join the party when don't look half-undead"
40992 b'When does the concert end?'
40993 b"I'm now at ming kang's house watching a movie, did father drive there? I was hoping for a ride"

44169 b'Nope. He just got it because he could'
44170 b"I don't know. He said soup but I didn't really see soup stuff"
44171 b'Then again, Mark is notoriously ridiculous'
44172 b"It's just a set stipend. He's spending money he could just have later lol"
44173 b"Hahah that's funny"
44174 b"I can't, wells Fargo is making me wait to deposit it"

44232 b'Not much cash, but my state id, cal card, military id, and debit card =/'
44233 b"Yeah, definitely. I'm also gonna check that auditorium"
44234 b"I think I lost my wallet =/ shit =/ the worst thing is, it's achecking habit that I've been forcing myself to quash and if I hadn'tI'd have it =/"
44235 b"Fuck I literally don't know what to do. If I don't find it I willhave no more than five bucks for a month because there's no accessiblewf"
44236 b'Did Mark switch classes?'
44237 b'Is he going?'
44238 b'Alright, thanks love.. this sucks'
44239 b'=/ I just want my ids... and if course this is the one time I have cash -.-'
44240 b"Alright.. <name> said he'd loan me money if I need it till then =)Fuck I can't even see walking in the rain, no joke"
44241 b'Yup.. two min if walking and I gave up avoiding puddles'
44242 b'Yeah xP debit will be here in <#> , the other guy rushed my creditfor <#> which is fine =D'
44243 b'Yeah.. so uh how will I fly without id?'
44244 b'Nope. I have a umich id and a birth certificate.. I have my soc cardand temp licence paper too I guess'
44245 b'Alright =/ fuck fuck fuck'
44246 b'Ohhhh snap'
44247 b"This just sucks so much. You know the fucked up part? If I just letmyself have my compulsions, I would've been checking for it"
44249 b'Something wrong? We can call if you want love'
44250 b"Oh it's fine lol"
44252 b'Playing my gihtar'
44253 b'Yup.. sup?'
44255 b"ILYMTYLMNR! Just wonderin' if you have any planideas about hangingout... also that imperial march was pretty great"
44256 b'Dayum you gon get all da bitches'
44258 b"I bet you're excited xP"
44259 b"Well to be fair I'm sure it'll be more reliable at least xP"
44260 b"Yeah haha.. Btw I'm crazy drowsy.. we can call if you want and if Istop responding wake my ass up"
44262 b'Alright, you?'
44264 b"That's not so strange lol. Just because you're unnecessarily hostiletowards any notion of religion.. =P"
44265 b"Iiii dunno. User your best judgement, we've been together for the years =P"
44266 b'Tshirt stage?'
44267 b'People are religious. They have beliefs. And not just because theywere forced to -.-'
44268 b"That's as bad as psycho religious people lol"
44270 b"You're the atheist equivalent of the Christian who screams thatyou'll go to hell if you read Harry Potter"
44272 b"I'm sure they think they're not like that too lol"
44273 b"Sorry, I just don't understand why you hate it so much"
44274 b'Okay, look down on it so much'
44275 b"In general I guess so, but if I knew one not like that - and I knowtons of great English majors - I'd see exceptions. You know Justinisn't just retarded"
44276 b"I wouldn't if she'd proven herself to be a cool person.. instead shesaid she was going to knock on each door to find me the first nighthere"
44277 b"Yeah, admittedly that was weird... but that could be just as muchpart of him being 'conservative'. Religious people aren't known forbeing against immigrant rights as far as I've seen lol"
44280 b"I guess... I just can't see it as a negative thing myself and don'tnecessarily find it even that illogical... if anything, it's a topicyou could literally never have an actual answer for"
44281 b"Because religion isn't just that"
44282 b"Plenty of religious people don't believe in bullshit creation mythsor impossible floods by god or whatever... they just believe an entityexists"
44283 b'No it\'s not. Religious people denying certain scientific facts likeevolution or the big bang or something are dumb and illogical and Ican\'t respect that either, but religion in conjunction with sense isfine... People like Justin likely don\'t think they\'re literallyreading Christ\'s flesh, and I\'m not arguing for every religious personout there... lots ARE batshit insane, like my grandma "healing mewith the power of Jesus", trust me I\'m not defending that'
44284 b'The thing is, people believe in organised religion without buyinginto every aspect of it... plus, lots of churches and things are verychill'
44285 b"I've gone to a lot of churches before for a lot of religions. Someare fucking nuts, others are just people who believe in an entity andalso known facts"
44286 b'At Unitarian churches you get lots of people from different religionswho just want a good community and chance to believe what they want,not really all that dumb I don\'t think... they\'re normal people whoagree with intellectual truths and happen to think "oh somethinggodlike is out there"'
44287 b"I don't think you do"
44288 b"I just don't understand why it's incompatible with reasonable thoughtif you take science over religion while still holding religiousbeliefs"
44289 b"Saying Earth is 6k years old or that woman came from a rib orwhatever is ridiculous... the actual entity isn't in my opinion. Ifscience could prove within reason that a kind if god didn't exist,it'd be ridiculous to believe in"
44290 b'I see a problem with believing in things counter to evidence we have,but not things without evidence'
44291 b'Saying creationism is real is nuts, because we can reasonably price that it is'
44293 b"Because it doesn't serve any purpose I guess... I don't know,religion is half to understand what you can't, primarily death. Thereis no other purpose for the unicorns and any other explanation oftotally unknown stuff could be just as wrong"
44294 b"Oh I know, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm sitting herethinking you're just a terrible person who hates him or that I'm onsome elevated plane of whatever lol... I just can tell you what weirdthings you do and get an explanation, whereas, say, Hemisha wouldscoff and berate you if you tried to have a similar conversation lol"
44295 b"And I conceded to whatever you say about Noah's Ark kind of people =P"
44296 b'Wtf really?'
44297 b'Getting the real frat experience I see'
44299 b'Hahahah I thought you meant the people outside'
44302 b"won't you feel dumb when the storm returns and you hear screams =P"

44304 b'HahaI should definitely finally make that French toast'
44306 b'Btw, SLUgS eventually? When should we plan to plan?'
44309 b"Please don't use your frustration with Savannah as a reason to get mad at me"
44310 b"I was sitting there saying that I had some idea of might might workand you kept offering advice I didn't ask for.. I've dealt with thisall day and didn't want to talk about it anymore.. you're the I've whoasked if I found it"
44311 b"Sorry but I've been running around all day and am sick of dealingwith wallet shit and your advice wasn't going to change anything"
44312 b"Then don't talk to me about things you just want sympathy on. Ever."
44313 b"I wasn't even talking about it to talk about it. I said I ess tiredfrom running around and you started asking about it"
