# Data preparation files
print_stats_and_group.py - To print statistics of smsCorpus.json and print the
                           SMS grouping in the students/ folder based on
                           student_ids.txt_
                           NOTE: Need to be run with Python 3 to give the same
                           result as the annotations we have here.
                           Python 2 behaves differently in terms of random
                           number generation although seed is the same
xml_to_txt.py - To convert the original XML file into txt (and JSON)
prepare_annotations.bash - To create the .ann files, and to set up the proper
                           permissions to the files and folders

# Brat annotation config files
annotations.conf - To define the list of tags
visual.conf - To define how the tags appear (the text and colors)
kb_shortcuts.conf - To define keyboard shortcut in annotating the text
tools.conf - To define other tools (tokenizer, etc.)

# Data Processing Flow
`python xml_to_txt.py` generates smsCorpus.json
`python3 print_stats_and_group.py` generates students/ folder and its contents
`bash prepare_annotations.bash` sets up students/ folder for annotation
After annotation process is completed, the script in data/ folder will follow
