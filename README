How to compile
==============
1. Get Maven (https://maven.apache.org)
2. Run `mvn package` on this folder
   This step will produce "target/experiments-smsnp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
3. The jar file can be executed with:
       java -jar target/experiments-smsnp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   See the scripts under experiments/ to see how it was used

To edit the source code properly, open as Maven project.
For example, in Eclipse, after opening this folder as normal Java project,
right-click on the project and click Configure -> Convert to Maven Project
