SMSNP Experiments
=================
This package contains everything necessary to replicate the experiments and all statistics in the paper:
Weak Semi-CRFs for NP Chunking in Informal Text.

### Dataset
The dataset is available at the data/ directory. Some notable files:
- smsCorpus_en_2015.03.09_all.txt
  The raw text version of the original NUS SMS Corpus
- smsCorpus_en_2015.03.09_all.regex.txt
  The tokenized version of the original NUS SMS Corpus, using Regex tokenizer available in SMSNPTokenizer
- sms_corpus/
  This folder contains the original annotations by students, in the original Brat annotation format.
  This folder also contains the scripts that were used to split the original SMS corpus into groups
- SMS_data_process.py
  This script is used to combine the annotations by students and split the data into training, development, and test set
  in 80%, 10%, 10% ratio.
  This script also contains the necessary adjustment to the annotation files, as some of the annotations were not made
  using the same Brat annotation tool.
  Running this script will produce the three files SMSNP.{train,dev,test}
- SMSNP.{train,dev,test}(.nnn)?
  The annotated SMS, split into three files.
  The number at the end of some files denote the number of instances in that file, as a reduced version of the full data
- SMSNP.conll.{regex,whitespace}(.gold)?.{train.dev.test}
  The tokenized version of the annotated dataset, using either Regex or Whitespace tokenizer.
  The optional .gold in the file name denotes whether the file was tokenized by also considering the gold annotation, 
  that is, if a word is partially marked as NP, then that word is split at the annotated NP boundary.

### Brown Cluster
