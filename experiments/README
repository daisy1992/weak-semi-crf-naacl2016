====================
Description of files
====================
train_all.bash - Run training of all models and all features in the paper
                 Note that this will train 120 models, with total size ~15GB
                 Total training time will be about one day on 4 threads
                 In actual experiments, we ran each parameter setting on 
                 separate AWS instance, downloading only the optimal model
train_all_optimal.bash - Run training of all models and all parameters, with the
                         optimal regularization parameter.
                         This will train 24 models with a total size ~3GB
                         Total training time will be a few hours on 4 threads
train_word_lcrf.bash - Run training of Linear CRF model
train_word_semi_crfs.bash - Run training of Semi-CRFs models

run_optimal_on_test.bash - Run testing on test set to produce *.result files
                           Note that this also gives character-level evaluation
                           The *.result files are used by calculate_CI.bash to
                           calculate the full table
calculate_CI.bash - Evaluate the *.result files and do significant test.
                    This is done both on character-level and word-level

The models are not included in this package, but can be obtained through the 
training process by running train_all_optimal.bash
